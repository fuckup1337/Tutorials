Getting around "su : must be run from a terminal"

I killed the sshd daemon from one of our servers by accident today. I wanted to avoid going to the data center, so I was able to upload and run a PHP script to give me a shell..

Problem was, that it would run under the www-data user and trying to su to root gave me the following message:

su : must be run from a terminal

After some googling, I found the solution from Tero's glob. If you have python installed, just run the following from your shell:

echo "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')" > /tmp/asdf.py
python /tmp/asdf.py

You now have a proper terminal, and things like 'su' will work as usual.
